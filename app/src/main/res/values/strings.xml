    <string name="review_content_example">Amazing. Visually stunning. So much going on, but somehow also clear and easy to understand. A little flabby in the middle third, but given the huge cast and story to cover it is very understandable. The highlight was the parings of characters from different stories and their interactions.</string>

    <string name="blade_runner_overview">Ridley Scott\'s definitive Blade Runner: The Final Cut (2007) includes extended scenes and new special effects. Harrison Ford stars in this fascinating, dark vision of the near future as a policeman who tracks engineered humans &#8212; a Blade Runner. In the year 2019, the police department forces Rick Deckard (Ford) out of retirement to hunt four genetically engineered humans who have come to earth. Designed to do difficult, hazardous work, the manufactured humans are stronger, faster and smarter than non engineered humans. They feel no pain or remorse; they are almost indistinguishable from other humans &#8230; and they are killing people. Now Deckard must stop them before they kill again.
